# C++ Data Types Overview


## Integer Types
Used to store whole numbers. Common types include `int` for general integer values and `char` for text characters encoded as bytes, which can also be interpreted as small integers.

## Boolean Type (`bool`)

C++ supports a `bool` type to represent Boolean values, which can be either `true` or `false`.

[!NOTE]
In C++, `true` is any non-zero value, and `false` is zero.


This type is useful for conditional statements and controlling program flow.



## Floating-Point Types
Used to store real numbers with decimal points. `float` is for single precision floating-point numbers, while `double` is for double precision, providing greater accuracy.

## Pointers
Variables that store memory addresses. They allow you to work directly with memory and manipulate data structures efficiently.

## Strings
Although not a basic data type, C++ handles strings as arrays of characters (similar to C). The C++ Standard Library provides the `string` class for a more convenient and flexible way to work with text data.
